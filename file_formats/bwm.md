## Description

The format `bwm` is an abbreviation for `Black & White Model`. As is the name
the format is used to describe in-game 3D models, it is built up of many
different data definitions such as: vertices, faces, materials, meshes, bones,
entities, etc..

A lot of this format is still unknown to me, but enough is known to read and
render static meshes.
