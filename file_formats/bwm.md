## Description

The format `bwm` is an abbreviation for `Black & White Model`. As is the name
the format is used to describe in-game 3D models, it is built up of many
different data definitions such as: vertices, faces, materials, meshes, bones,
entities, etc..

A lot of this format is still unknown to me, but enough is known to read and
render static meshes.

## File Format

### Header
The file has a header identifying the file format and version: ASCII
`LiOnHeAdMODEL`, followed by `27 bytes` of null padding. Followed by a `uint32`
possibly describing the version. Then followed again by another `uint32` that
must be set to `0x2B00B1E5`. :smirk:
