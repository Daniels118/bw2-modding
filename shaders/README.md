## Encrypted Shaders

The game's shaders are stored in `data\encryptedshaders` - they are encrypted
very basically using a caeser shift (3+).

A simple C# program to decrypt them can be used: [decrypt.cs](decrypt.cs)

## Decrypted Shaders

You can find already decrypted files here: [DecryptedShaders](DecryptedShaders)

All shaders require DirectX PixelShader 2.0.
